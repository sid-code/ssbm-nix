# FAQ
## How do I enable the GCC overclock adapter?
Enable the configuration option:
``` nix
ssbm.gcc.oc-kmod.enable = true;
```

After building that configuration and switching to it, load the module:
``` sh
sudo modprobe gcadpter_oc
```

The kernel module will be reloaded automatically on subsequent boots, since the flake updates `boot.kernelModules`.
